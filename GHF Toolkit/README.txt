GHF Toolkit 2.1 is a hacking toolkit designed as a multipurpose file repository for pentesting, red teams, data breaching, or any other ethical and/or legal uses for it. There are several scripts that make up PGV Toolkit 2.1, with each of their purposes are described below.


-GHF Analyzer is designed to ping a valid IPv4 address (within certain proximity) in order to display its speed based on the area it is tested from. Please note that results will increase in accuracy the closer you are to the target IP.

-GHF Reporter is a command shortcut that generates a report of certain WiFi interactions on your connected network within the past 3 days.
Some information on this report may include: How much internet connection a network had at specific times, when the network was connected to or disconnected from, the power state of a wireless adapter at certain times, etc.

-GHF Bruteforcer is a tool that can find the password to almost anything, so long as you have the targetâ€™s username and IPv4 address. It comes with a passlist containing all 10,000 possible 4-digit numeric passwords. This passlist is strongly recommended for hacking into things like phones, tablets, or anything else that may use a 4-digit numeric password. In many other cases, 4-digit pins are not commonly used. Therefore, if you are attempting to gain access to something like a PC, laptop, WiFi networks, or anything else that uses a standard alphanumeric password, it is highly recommended that you use a famous passlist. One example is the world-renowned rockyou.txt, which held approximately 32 million passwords as result of a massive data-breach in 2009. However, by 2021, rockyou.txt was suspected to contain over 8.4 billion passwords. The exact number is unknown to this day. Regardless of what passlist you use, GHF Bruteforcer should find the password of most devices or networks. If this is not the case, feel free to contact The Greyhound Foundation for support or feedback.



Please note that GHF Toolkit 2.1 is subject to change, this being addition/removal of certain scripts, termination of GHF Toolkit 2.1 in order to replace it with a newer rendition, and/or any other authorized modifications to the toolkit that may occur.
